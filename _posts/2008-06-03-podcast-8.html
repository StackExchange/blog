<p>
This is the eighth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of our next podcast, we will be hosted at <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/index.html">ITConversations</a> -- the <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> of podcasts. A good outfit to be associated with!
</li>
<li>Yes, Joel does pronounce "wav file" as "<i>wohv</i> file". I have no idea. Ask him.
</li>
<li>Joel keynoted the Rails conference. Josh Susser said <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/5/31/quick-railsconf-update">"If you missed it, count yourself lucky."</a> Apparently at least David Heinemeier Hansson liked it.
</li>
<li>It's true that I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001065.html">objected to David's attitude towards people who don't use Macs</a>, but it's possible to have objections to specific statements people make, or specific beliefs they may have, and still respect them as a person. Disagreement does not mean we are mortal enemies. David has a lot of smart, interesting things to say. That just wasn't one of them.
</li>
<li>"The programming community is larger than any one particular tribe." But why are certain communities more insular and insecure than others? Joel relates this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>.
</li>
<li>I remain a big fan of Clay Shirky and his latest book. How big a fan? <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001122.html">It's Clay Shirky's Internet, We Just Live In It</a>. I believe every working programmer who touches the web should read his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594201536/codinghorror-20">Here Comes Everybody</a>.
</li>
<li>On addressing criticism -- "there arise a new, young generation of rebels who remember not when you were the young rebel, writing new things, and making no claim to authority."
</li>
<li>I found <a href="http://barracadopaulo.blogspot.com/">Paulo's thoughtful criticism</a> of our podcast and I wanted to address it. To quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Randy Pausch</a>: "That’s a lesson that stuck with me my whole life. When you see yourself doing something badly and nobody’s bothering to tell you anymore, that’s a very bad place to be. <b>Your critics are your ones telling you they still love you and care.</b>"
</li>
<li>Joel feels like he was <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html">misunderstood on the topic of exceptions</a>. Well, if you were writing a memory allocator for an operating system, anyway.
</li>
<li>Joel and I do agree that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2008/01/30/why-threading-is-hard.aspx">threading is hard</a>. It's amazing that web apps largely get a pass on this, thanks to the architecture of the webserver model.
</li>
<li>I give a shout-out to Rick Brewster of <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a> who calls the (excellent) threading code he wrote in Paint.NET <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000169.html">"easily the most complex code in Paint.NET"</a>
</li>
<li>We're using SQL Server 2005 as the underlying database for stackoverflow.com. We engage in a brief discussion of the pros and cons of Oracle and MySQL databases in our (limited) experience.
</li>
<li>Joel describes his frustration with the way some writers turn single anecdotes into statements of truth, both on the internet and off. Of course Joel and I are both guilty of this, too.
</li>
<li>In my better blog posts, I tend to use more of a meta-aggregation model, where I do research and summarize what I found. I point to a lot of different opinions, then offer my own -- but I try to diligently avoid clinging religiously to my opinions. In the face of new, better data, I can be convinced. I firmly believe in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001124.html">strong opinions, weakly held</a>.
</li>
<li>When it comes to Domain Specific Languages, we definitely prefer them to a bunch of XML. I am particularly fond of SQL and Regular Expressions as mini-DSLs -- I believe in embracing the concept of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000989.html">languages inside languages</a>.
</li>
<li>Joel and I are still very excited about Microsoft's DLR (<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a> and <a href="http://www.ironruby.net/">IronRuby</a>) as an escape route from the superficial differences between <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000519.html">the Coke and Pepsi of C# and VB.NET</a>.
</li>
<li>welcome <a href="http://twitter.com/SuperDalgas">Geoff Dalgas</a> to the stackoverflow.com programming team!
</li>
<li>As usual, thank you for all the questions and for the Wiki edits!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also answered the following listener question:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Tendayi Mawushe</b>: In the enterprise Java world, you can't do much without writing a lot of XML. In response to that, a new idea little domain specific languages is emerging. What are your thoughts on this?
</li>
</ol>
