This is the fifteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief discussion of our shoestring budget, and the project schedule. The beta for Stack Overflow is close; we will likely be trickling people in by the end of the month.</li>
<li>Strategies for handling recurring or background tasks in ASP.NET. We have <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/easy-background-tasks-in-aspnet/">a simple method</a> that works for now.</li>
<li>Being a stellar software developer does not necessarily equate to being a stellar manager of software developers. Promoting your best coders is not always the best strategy. We highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633439/?tag=codinghorror-20">Peopleware</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159059844X/?tag=codinghorror-20">Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager</a>. If you're a manager, staple these books to your face! Live it, learn it, love it! If you know someone who is a manager of software developers, staple these books to <em>their</em> face. They're that important.</li>
<li>Joel's essential time management tip: get things done by not reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142000280/?tag=codinghorror-20">Getting Things Done</a>. Personally, my time management is terrible, but I do have one guiding principle: produce some kind of small public artifact every day. We can recommend <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann's excellent site 43Folders</a>, which is sort of a long running geek love letter to that book.</li>
<li>I argure that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001147.html">regions are the GOTO of code formatting</a>. I navigate in Visual Studio using search as my metaphor. Between CTRL+I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000432.html">incremental search</a> and CTRL+SHIFT+F find in project, I'm never more than a few keystrokes away from whatever code I need to see. Your code is full of highly unique keywords, just like the web is full of unique search terms.</li>
<li>Joel and I both agree: one of the most effective coding practices you can adopt on your team is interactive, sit-down-with-your-coworker code review. 90% of the things you will learn have nothing to do with the code. I believe programming is a far more social activity than most realize. If you write code, and nobody but you <em>ever</em> sees that code -- did you really extract all the benefit from writing that code?</li>
<li>When it comes to interviewing software developers, it seems there are two classes of interviews: the kind where the interviewee gets to drive, and the kind where the interviewer does all the driving. Try to have a game plan for both types of interviews. Be yourself, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000104.html">build a portfolio</a>, and actively study the company you're interviewing at. For some interviews, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000628.html">you really do need to prepare</a> -- practice, practice, practice!</li>
<li>We can't talk about programming interviews without mentioning <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/">classic interview puzzles</a> and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316778494/?tag=codinghorror-20">How Would You Move Mount Fuji</a>?</li>
<li>On the amazing power of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx">lambda expressions</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173171(VS.80).aspx">delegates</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0yw3tz5k(VS.80).aspx">anonymous methods</a>. Fun stuff!</li>
<li>If ACME is in the business of developing explosive widgets, is it unreasonable for them to inevitably outsource their software development to Coders R Us? If you're serious about software engineering as a career, you deserve to work at a company that is serious about software engineering, too. This usually means choosing to work for a company where software is at the core of their business model. See <a href="http://www.hjiang.net/wp/2008/01/05/joel-spolskys-talk-at-yale/">Joel's Talk at Yale</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We answered the following listener questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gordon Milne</strong>: "I have an opportunity to pursue a more manegerial role; how do you feel about making the transition from developer to being responsible for other developers?"
</li>
<li><strong>Jason Zimpelmann:</strong> "What sorts of time management skills do you use?" and "What about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001147.html">that posting on region blocks</a>?"</li>
<li><strong>Aviv Ben-Yosef</strong>: "Should code review be done alone via email or in person?"</li>
<li><strong>David McGraw</strong>: "What advice would you give college graduates who are interviewing for programming jobs?"</li>
<li><strong>Adam Haile</strong>: "How do you handle pointers to functions in the .NET world?"</li>
<li><strong>Mat&iacute;as A. Bellone</strong>: "Outsourcing has been putting food on my table for the past few years. What are your feelings on this?"</li>
</ol>
