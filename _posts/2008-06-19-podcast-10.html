<p>
This is the tenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and Jeff discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We provide some background for new listeners on what Stack Overflow will be. See <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/04/16.html">Joel's post</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001101.html">Jeff's post</a>.</li>
<li>Although we have ambivalent feelings about <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">Expert's Exchange</a>, what we're doing with Stack Overflow is similar, and they do have a sense of humor -- and invited me to a conference.</li>
<li>We will be using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa&amp;wiki=true">cc-wiki licensing terms</a> for content posted on Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>Hopefully we can ship before <a href="http://www.uberreview.com/2008/06/15-years-of-windows-apps-in-linux-wine-hits-version-10.htm">Wine</a> (which just hit version 1 after 15 years) and Duke Nukem Forever. Check out <a href="http://duke.a-13.net/">a list of things that have happened</a> since Duke Nukem Forever began development.</li>
<li>I confess that I was shocked to find out, while listening to our own podcasts, I wasn't hearing everything Joel was saying! Listening is hard. Make sure you're thinking about this the next time you listen to someone.</li>
<li>Joel has fun with <a href="http://www.instantrimshot.com/">instantrimshot.com</a> and I mention <a href="http://sadtrombone.com/">sadtrombone.com</a> ; these are excellent examples of the emerging classes of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/02/single-serving-sites">single-serving websites</a>.</li>
<li>You crazy hackers figured out our super-secret beta website URL! I invite participation for the upcoming private beta, but our in-development site is not suitable for human consumption at this point. There is a special prize for those hardy few that "hacked" their way into the development site, though.</li>
<li>A brief discussion of the badges that you can earn while participating in the Stack Overflow site. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinking_badges">We don't need no stinkin' badges</a>, of course, but I think they'll be fun and complimentary to the reputation system. </li>
<li>Stack Overflow edits will only be possibly for users who have earned a little bit of reputation on the site by actively participating. This is where we diverge a smidge from Wikipedia, which still (amazingly!) allows regular anonymous edits. But I think it's a reasonable compromise: anonymous people can ask and answer, but not edit.</li>
<li>Jarrod did a tremendous job of getting our one-click build set up: it deploys the database, the code, and even runs unit tests against the website before deploying it. We're using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0k6kkbsd.aspx">MSBuild</a> and <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php">nUnit</a>.</li>
<li>Joel references <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471197130/?tag=codinghorror-20">AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis (Paperback)</a>, and describes a few of the anti-patterns he's seen while developing small apps at Fog Creek for internal use.</li>
<li>On <a href="http://www.hjiang.net/wp/2008/01/05/joel-spolskys-talk-at-yale/">the dangers of being an internal IT developer</a>. This is important if you love coding.</li>
<li>One of personal favorite bits of Joel's writing, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000346.html">on cleaning the toilet</a>. Naturally.</li>
<li>Sometimes as a manager, it's your job to do the grubby, ugly stuff so the sales guys can sell and the developers can develop.</li>
<li>We use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> for Subversion integration as almost all other Windows developers do. But as Visual Studio developers, we've also adopted <a href="http://www.visualsvn.com/">VisualSVN</a>, which I highly recommend! It makes working with Subversion a pleasure instead of a chore, at least in my opinion. </li>
<li>At Fog Creek, they're switching to <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> source control, which like <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> is part of the new, emerging class of distributed version control.</li>
<li>Source control remains <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000643.html">the bedrock of software engineering</a>. I meet so few software developers, myself included, that really understand source control. Just <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html">avoid SourceSafe at all costs</a>, and understand <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000968.html">the value of branching and merging</a>.</li>
<li>Is there anything positive anyone can possibly say about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windowsmobile/default.mspx">Windows Mobile</a>? How can something six versions old be this terrible? It should be razed to the ground and reinvented, ala Zune and Xbox 360. Can <a href="http://code.google.com/android/what-is-android.html">Google's Android</a> be like Windows Mobile, sans all the sucking? I expect Apple to dominate this closed ecosystem; it plays to all their strengths.</li>
<li>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language">Ruby</a> performance, scaling, "enterpriseyness" and whether or not this is even the right question to ask. Shouldn't we be thinking of this in terms of the solution first, and the language as a side-effect of that?</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also answered the following listener questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sebastian Dwornik</strong>: "Doesn't the current mobile phone platform war remind you of the PC platform wars?"
</li>
<li><strong>Loren Norman</strong>: "When will Ruby be ready for enterprise development?"</li>
</ol>
