<p>
This is the eighteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We finally get to meet Michael Pryor, the <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/About.html">co-founder of Fog Creek Software</a>, who is a special guest on this episode!
</li>
<li>Joel had good luck browsing our beta site using <a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a>. I'm still incredibly impressed with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/safari.html">Mobile Safari</a> browser on the iPhone, which renders our JavaScript-heavy site perfectly, as far as I can tell.</li>
<li>Joel posted a Regex question on the Stack Overflow beta, and I can't help bringing up <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/">RegexBuddy</a>, my favorite (and still best) regular expression tool for developers.</li>
<li>Social websites are a bit unpredictable to build -- we intended Stack Overflow as a relatively straightforward question / answer site, but there's quite a bit of demand for inter-answer discussion. Our system is designed to float the best answers to the top via voting, but this makes conversations in the answers difficult to follow.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow is a hybrid of a discussion forum, a wiki system, and a voting/reputation system. It's been a hit so far, but we are running into some design issues resulting from this unusual combination.</li>
<li>I had the opportunity last week to meet <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a>, who Joel and I are big fans of. Joel particularly enjoys their podcast, <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today</a>. Turns out Merlin is a fan of Joel's as well. We should form a mutual admiration society!</li>
<li>If you'd like to sign up for the Stack Overflow private beta, which will run until the end of the month, <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pKxDW35algYdxrCnzW-OLag">use our Google Docs signup form</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn't get to any listener questions this episode, but we'll remedy that next time!</p>
<p>If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to <a href="mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com">podcast@stackoverflow.com</a>. You can <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/recording-podcast-questions-using-your-telephone/">record a question</a> using nothing but a telephone and a web browser.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?pg=pgWiki&amp;command=view&amp;ixWikiPage=24213">transcript wiki</a> for this episode is available for public editing.</p>
